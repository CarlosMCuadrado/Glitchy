Glitchy is an image manipulator, made in 2015 as a finals project for the AP Graduate in Computer Science, at the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. 
The purpose of this software is to give those who enjoy making glitch art a better user experience, compared to working with software such as Audacity, while still maintaining the idea of manipulating images on a byte-level. 

Features
* Import images, and manipulate them linearly, as a series of pixels/colors.

* Apply various effects.

* Merge images, pixel by pixel, in 4 different ways, to get vastly different results.

* Change canvas width and height, independent of images.

* Import any filetype, and convert its raw data to pixels, that can be rendered as an image.

* Save and load your current images, and their applied effects, as projects.
